The actual output states it is \"a city\" but omits the crucial detail that it is \"the capital\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Check if there are any contradicting facts in the actual output**\n    *   The actual output \"Paris is a city in France\" is factually correct and does not contradict the expected answer. However, it is an incomplete answer to the implied question (\"What is the capital of France?\") as it misses the key information about Paris being the *capital*.\n\nThe actual output is factually true as far as it goes, but it fails to convey the *core fact* that Paris is the *capital* of France, which is the essential piece of information in the expected answer. It's partially correct because it correctly identifies Paris and its location in France.\n\nSCORE: 5"
